"""Offline-suite fixtures: keep every test in this directory off the network.

``tests/conftest.py`` already does this for the inherited suite, but that
fixture is scoped to ``tests/`` and does not apply to this sibling directory.
This copy keeps the same behaviour so offline cases fail loudly, rather than
silently reaching a vendor, if they attempt network access.
